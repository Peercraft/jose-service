# How to use #

## Before to use ##

### JWS or JWE

This library is able to create and load signed (JWS) and enrypted (JWE).

JWS are digital signed using one (or more) private key(s). The receiver of this JOT will be able to verify this signature is valid using your public key. If the signature is valid, the receiver can consider that the data received have not been modified and that your are the sender.

JWE are encrypted using public keys of one (or more) recipient(s). A recipient will be able decrypt the data using its private key.

You can create signed and encrypted data. You have to create Ã  JWS and then create a JWE.

### JWK

The keys used to sign and encrypt are JWK objects.

A public key is used to verify a digital signature and to encrypt data using. A private key can sign and decrypt data.

There are four types of keys:

* `RSA` keys,
* `EC` (Elliptic Curves) keys,
* `oct` keys,
* `dir` keys.

A key can be used with different algorithms. But an algorithm only supports one type. For example, `ES256`, `ES384` and `ES512` algorithms only accept `EC` keys. See [the algorithms page](Keys.md) to know which type of key you need for your algorithm.

### JWKSet

You can group your keys in a JWKSet object. This object accepts any kind of JWK objects. It is recommended to group your public and private keys in different JWKSet.

All JWK and JWKSet are managed using a JWKManager object.

**Note: in a near futur, the JWKManager will be splitted into two managers: JWKManager and JWKSetManager**

### Data

A JWS or JWE object includes a signed data or an encrypted data. This library supports any type of data that are serializable (all types supported by `json_encode`).

So you can sign or encrypt

* a number: 3.14159265359
* a string: "Long live and prosper"
* an array: {"iss":"my.example.com","sub":"me@example.com","is_admin":true}
* a key (JWK object)
* a set of private keys (JWKSet object)
* a JWT object.
* an object that implements `JsonSerializable`

## Creation of my first JOSE ##

In this example, we suppose that you already have (extended the required components)[Extend the library](Extend.md).


In this example, you are Alice and you want to send a very important message to Bob: ```"Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM"```.

The public key of Bob is a RSA Certificate. Using JWK representation, it will be:

```php

    array(
        "kty" => "RSA",
        "n"   =>"sXchDaQebHnPiGvyDOAT4saGEUetSyo9MKLOoWFsueri23bOdgWp4Dy1WlUzewbgBHod5pcM9H95GQRV3JDXboIRROSBigeC5yjU1hGzHHyXss8UDprecbAYxknTcQkhslANGRUZmdTOQ5qTRsLAt6BTYuyvVRdhS8exSZEy_c4gs_7svlJJQ4H9_NxsiIoLwAEk7-Q3UXERGYw_75IDrGA84-lA_-Ct4eTlXHBIY2EaV7t7LjJaynVJCpkv4LKjTTAumiGUIuQhrNhZLuF_RJLqHpM2kgWFLU7-VTdL1VbC2tejvcI2BlMkEpk1BzBZI0KQB0GaDWFLN-aEAw3vRw",
        "e"   =>"AQAB",
    );
```

**Note: to create such array from a X509 certificate, you can use the following method:**

```php

    <?php
    use SpomkyLabs\Jose\Util\RSAConverter;

    $certificate = RSAConverter::loadKeyFromFile("/path/to/your/certificate", "passphrase"); //This method also accepts a string of the certificate in PEM format. "passphrase" is the passphrase used to secure the private key. This argument is optional.
```

Alice will encrypt the message (=create a JWE object) using the key encryption algorithm ```RSA-OAEP-256``` and the content encryption algorithm ```A256CBC-HS512```.

As there is only one receiver, we can use the compact serialization.

```php

    <?php
    //We create and configure instances of JWKManager and JWTManager
    $aliceJWK = ...; //The key of Alice (JWK object). See above.
    $bobJWK   = ...; //The key of Bob (JWK object). See below.
    $message  = "Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM";

	//We create an encryption instruction
    $instruction = new EncryptionInstruction();
    $instruction->setRecipientPublicKey($bobJWK)
    $instruction->setSenderPrivateKey($aliceJWK); //This is not mandatory execpt when using specific algorithms (e.g. ECDH-ES)

    //The first argument is the data you want to encrypt
    //The second argument is an aray of instructions. We have only one.
    //The third argument is the shared protected headers. We set the algorithms and we want to compress the data before encryption using the DEFLATE method.
    //The fourth argument is the unprotected shared headers. We set nothing because the compact serialization method does not support it
    //The fifth argument define the expected serialization method.
	$jwe = $encrypter->encrypt($message, array($instruction), array("enc" => "A256CBC-HS512", "alg" => "RSA-OAEP-256", "zip" => "DEF"), array(), JSONSerializationModes::JSON_COMPACT_SERIALIZATION);
```

The variable ```$jwe``` now contains your ecnrypted message. You can send it to Bob. The encrypted message will look like:

```php

    eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUC0yNTYiLCJlbmMi...8drPvQGxL6L_r
```

## Load a JOSE ##

Bob received the message from Alice and want to decrypt the message. Bob has the private key used to encrypt this message in its JWKSet (managed by its JWKManager object).

The private key of Bob is:

```php

    array(
        "kty" => "RSA",
        "n"   =>"sXchDaQebHnPiGvyDOAT4saGEUetSyo9MKLOoWFsueri23bOdgWp4Dy1WlUzewbgBHod5pcM9H95GQRV3JDXboIRROSBigeC5yjU1hGzHHyXss8UDprecbAYxknTcQkhslANGRUZmdTOQ5qTRsLAt6BTYuyvVRdhS8exSZEy_c4gs_7svlJJQ4H9_NxsiIoLwAEk7-Q3UXERGYw_75IDrGA84-lA_-Ct4eTlXHBIY2EaV7t7LjJaynVJCpkv4LKjTTAumiGUIuQhrNhZLuF_RJLqHpM2kgWFLU7-VTdL1VbC2tejvcI2BlMkEpk1BzBZI0KQB0GaDWFLN-aEAw3vRw",
        "e"   =>"AQAB",
        "d"   =>"VFCWOqXr8nvZNyaaJLXdnNPXZKRaWCjkU5Q2egQQpTBMwhprMzWzpR8Sxq1OPThh_J6MUD8Z35wky9b8eEO0pwNS8xlh1lOFRRBoNqDIKVOku0aZb-rynq8cxjDTLZQ6Fz7jSjR1Klop-YKaUHc9GsEofQqYruPhzSA-QgajZGPbE_0ZaVDJHfyd7UUBUKunFMScbflYAAOYJqVIVwaYR5zWEEceUjNnTNo_CVSj-VvXLO5VZfCUAVLgW4dpf1SrtZjSt34YLsRarSb127reG_DUwg9Ch-KyvjT1SkHgUWRVGcyly7uvVGRSDwsXypdrNinPA4jlhoNdizK2zF2CWQ",
    );
```

To decrypt the message, Bob will load the data he received:

```php

    <?php

    $result = $loader->load("eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUC0yNTYiLCJlbmMi...8drPvQGxL6L_r");
```

If you want to use a specific key set, you can pass it as second argument.

```php

    <?php

	$my_keyset = ...; //A JWKSet object that contains keys.

    $result = $loader->load("eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUC0yNTYiLCJlbmMi...8drPvQGxL6L_r", $my_keyset);
```

The variable ```$result``` now contains an object that implements JWEInterface. You can get the headers (protected or unprotected) and the message of Alice: 

```php

    echo $result->getPayload(); // "Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM"
```
